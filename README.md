# code_sample
This program parses XML files from the Catalan/Spanish Ancora Corpus and extracts ambiguous anaphoric references between two sentences. It outputs a CSV file where it enlists detailed grammatical and discoursive information. Specifically, it shows whether the ambiguous pronoun referes to the previous subject or object. The aim of analysing the data set extracted was to find which factors correleate significantly with pronouns that are subject biased or rather object biased. 

This code was written during my master thesis in linguistics and shall represent an example of my coding experience.
